=====================

USC Spring 2013 - GlassLine Factory project for CS 201

The Glass Line was a five-team project to create a factory that would produce individualized pieces of glass according to their recipe. It was programmed in Java using Eclipse IDE and we used Github to manage our code.

The Glass Line was required to be able to produce pieces of glass as efficiently and safely as possible. This meant that no matter how many pieces of glass were created or the speed in which they were created, the program should be able to run smoothly.

I was tasked to create the agents for one of the conveyor families. This meant creating the backend for the two sensors, conveyor, popup, robot and machine as well as connecting them to their graphical representations.

This is my side of the code: https://github.com/dany1532/GlassLine/tree/master/src/engine/agent/family1
